# java-raytracer

This repository contains an extense series of classes that makeup together a raytracing render engine that can be used to generate realistic images.
Some of its features are:
- Hard shadows,
- Blinn-Phong reflection model,
- Point and directional lights,
- Orthogonal and perspective cameras.
- Simple 3D objects classes such as spheres and planes, and
- An OBJReader class capable of loading 3D models with the .obj file extension,

The main class ```JavaRaytracer``` is the entry point of this program. It cointains already some basic methods that return some sample scenes that
demonstrate the capabilities of this projetc.

You may feel free to create your own custom scenes using the classes that are provided by this repository and run the program in order to render
any scene you want.
